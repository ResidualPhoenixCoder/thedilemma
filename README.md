Game: The Dilemma
=================

<p>
The Dilemma is a trivia game played between two players at a time. 
A question is presented to both players at which point each player has ten seconds to 
choose one of multiple choices as their answer. In addition to choosing an answer each 
player chooses whether they would like to hide, share, or lie about their answer to the 
other player. If a player chooses to share or lie about their answer then the other player 
will be given a chance to decide whether they want to stick with their original answer or 
switch to the answer given to them by the other player. To help each player decide what to do 
with their answers they are given the strengths, weaknesses, and overall reputation of the other 
player.
</p>

<p>
Strengths and weaknesses are categories of questions in which the player does their best or 
worse in based upon past performance. The reputation assigned to each player is based off of 
their history of hiding, sharing, or lying about their answers.
</p>

<p>
Points are awarded to a player based upon the correctness of their answer, the correctness of 
the other player's answer, and the action they chose (Hide/Share/Lie). If a player chooses to 
hide or lie about their answer, and answer correctly, they receive more points than they would 
have sharing their answer, and earn even more points if the other player chooses an incorrect 
answer (incentive to lie to throw off the other player). Although lying and hiding an answer is 
potentially more rewarding, it comes with a negative point penalty if the question is answered 
incorrectly (incentive to be cooperative).
